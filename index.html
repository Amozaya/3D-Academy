                        My name is Oleg and I am based in London, UK. I have been doing 3D modeling for over 5 years. 
                        My professional experience includes working as a freelancer, as a character artist on a game called “Wayward Realms” by OnceLost Games, and working with Technicolor as a 3D Modeler. 
                        I know how hard it might be to start learning new skills, and that is why I created this online school. 
                        No matter if you are completely new to 3D modeling or looking to level up your skills, online courses at 3D Academy can help you achieve your goals!
