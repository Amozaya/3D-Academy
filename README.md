## Testing

In this section I did some of the automated and manual tests in order to ensure that project is functioning correctly.

### Validator Testing

* **HTML**

-After using W3C Validator I have recieved one warning about my HTML code that suggests using headings for "section" elements:

![HTML Warning message](assets/images/w3c-validator.JPG)

-In this situation, instead of adding headers directly inside the section, I have created separate section inside of my HTML code that contains a header element for each of the section. I found this way to be easier to align the elements and apply different style to them.
